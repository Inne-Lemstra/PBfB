Ik heb geen idee hoe markdown werkt dus ik ga nu wat testen

Heb ik gedaan:

Logged in agian after a long time to github.
Avatar was still uptodate thx to gravatar
Made a new RSA key for my latop
Added a new RSA public key

followed a bunch of people
Watched some repos

Made an issue an the Fairytale repo to ask to be collaborator
Got to colaborate, sweet.

Made some changes to the story (using a pokemon go reference as message)
tried to push. Turned out lots of people working on the same time.
So commiting was annoying (lots of typing)

Created a shell script to automate commiting when called
Tried it a bit. It worked

Thought it might be easier if everyone had this. So you had less time between
Finishing writing and changing master branch. So less oportunity for other people
To change things in the main time.
